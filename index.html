Youâ€™ve got to be quick so John Wick can secure the bag and achieve the epic Victory Royale. Be careful of bush campers and stay clear of ghoul troopers.

In this click based adventure you will be given multiple choices and strategies to win, but you must choose wisely. Only one path can help secure the victory.
